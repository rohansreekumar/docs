The property was foreclosed and repossessed by a lender when the owner failed to make payments. A bank is now the owner. Since banks are not in business to own homes, they are usually interested in selling foreclosed homes quickly at attractive low prices. A list price is published but reasonable offers can be submitted for consideration. Offers can be submitted through the official Listing Agent but in some cases, no agent is listed and offers can be submitted the bank owner directly.","property_type":"RESIDENTIAL","lng":-76.26069,"lsid":"79969","listing_date":"2014-12-18T17:14:17Z","supplier_listing_id":"109278858","county":"NORFOLK CITY","last_update":"2015-07-06T20:00:27Z","premier_flag":"N","country":"US","sz_id":400028655926,"office_id":2631796,"propid":"223799929","latlng_combo":"36.89769,-76.26069","beds":3,"total_baths":1.0,"state":"VA","supplier_id":537,"zip":"23509","price":186269,"mls_number":"106126416","acct_level":"F","lat":36.89769,"acct_type":"AGENT","city":"NORFOLK","cbsa":"47260","address_mapped":"625 GARREN AVE;NORFOLK;VA;23509;US","agent_id":14813246,"maponics_schools":["P_sch_name;WILLARD MODEL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL","P_hdcgrd;C+","P_pupteach;16.97","P_nces_schid;510267001087","P_sch_dist;0.76","P_district;NORFOLK CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS","P_nces_disid;5102670","P_assigned;Y","M_sch_name;LAFAYETTE-WINONA MIDDLE SCHOOL","M_hdcgrd;C","M_nces_schid;510267000359","M_sch_dist;0.99","M_district;NORFOLK CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS","M_nces_disid;5102670","M_assigned;Y","H_sch_name;MAURY HIGH SCHOOL","H_hdcgrd;A-","H_pupteach;14.31","H_nces_schid;510267001117","H_sch_dist;2.80","H_district;NORFOLK CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS","H_nces_disid;5102670","H_assigned;Y"],"image_count":0,"image_count_acctmod":0,"premier_snipe":1,"detail_attributes":["dma_name;Norfolk-Portsmouth-Newport-News-544","ld_agent_name;UltraForeclosures UltraForeclosures","ld_broker_name;UltraForeclosures"],"city_preferred":"NORFOLK","nbhd_search":["ROLAND PARK"],"nbhd_details":["Roland Park;N"],"latlng_combo_zip":"36.8784,-76.2611","homescom_url":"www.homes.com/property/norfolk-va-23509/id-223799929/","latlng_combo_rpt":["36.89769,-76.26069"],"latlng_combo_str_11":"dq9cbth8t5u","latlng_combo_str_10":"dq9cbth8t5","latlng_combo_str_9":"dq9cbth8t","latlng_combo_str_8":"dq9cbth8","latlng_combo_str_7":"dq9cbth","latlng_combo_str_6":"dq9cbt","latlng_combo_str_5":"dq9cb","latlng_combo_str_4":"dq9c","latlng_combo_str_3":"dq9","latlng_combo_str_2":"dq","latlng_combo_str_1":"d","sort_score":950000,"local_connect_yn":"N","technical":["solr_refresh;1.19.0"],"timestamp":"2015-07-07T09:16:17.334Z"}]}}
